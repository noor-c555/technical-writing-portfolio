## 1.2: System Overview 

The main functionalities of our Issue Tracking System include:
- Creating a product listing 
- Creating a product release
- Allowing users to request changes
- Keeping track of change items and all those who requested them
- Searching for and viewing change items
- Updating change items
- Printing reports 

There are several advantages that come with these functionalities all being available in 
one place, some of which include…

* Increased productivity

  Without this software, many of the tasks listed above would have to be done by 
hand. Doing tasks by hand/on paper is not only much slower to process, it also 
must go through many people before being properly assigned to the right person 
to work on the issue being tracked.

* Eco-Friendly

  Eliminating the use of paper allows this software to aid in helping the 
environment. 

* Organization

  Some might think that seeing everything all in one place is disorganized, but that 
is far from the truth. Imagine being able to request the information you want to 
see with the click of a button. Now imagine having to sift through a bunch of files 
to see the same information…

* Direct feedback from customers

  Although customers do not physically use the software, they are still able to 
create requests through customer service representatives. Feedback from 
customers is essential to a company’s growth, having the means to do this is an 
advantage given to any company that uses our software.
